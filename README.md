# Sqrl - TELOS Block Producer Voting & Wallet

`Sqrl` is a fully functional release of a light wallet being designed for the TELOS blockchain, and supports any EOSIO blockchain. This application can be used to connect to a remote EOSIO API endpoint to perform producer voting actions and common wallet commands.

### Features

- **New User Account Creation**: Sqrl provides a simple wizard that allows new users to create their first TELOS account on their own.
- **Works Across Chains**: Sqrl is the only wallet that can be used to manage any EOSIO blockchain in a single interface, such as TELOS or EOS Mainnet.
- **New TLOS Key Generation**: You can use Sqrl to generate new TLOS public and private key pairs.
- **Block Producer/Proxy Voting**: Select which block producers to support and cast your vote. You can also register/unregister your account as a Proxy. Please note that the block producer voting UI is not a research tool; it is a simple interface that provides a secure way to vote.
- **Token Transfers**: Transfer TLOS or any other token you may have a balance for to another user or exchanges.
- **CPU/Bandwidth Staking**: Stake your TLOS as either Bandwidth or CPU. This grants rights to resource usage on the network, in addition to conveying weight while voting for block producers.
- **Buy/Sell RAM**: Use your TLOS tokens to buy or sell RAM at the then market price. RAM allows you to reserve or release storage space on the TELOS blockchain.
- **Create Accounts**: Sqrl allows you to create new user accounts in TELOS and allocate RAM, Bandwidth or CPU.
- **Simple Contact Management**: You can create a contact database for the TELOS accounts you interact with frequently, which simplifies the process of sending / receiving of TLOS on the network.
- **Interact w/ Smart Contracts**: If you would like to interact with smart contracts directly, Sqrl allows you to lookup contracts and call methods defined in the contract's abi.
- **Local Wallet**: Set a password while importing your private key to create a local wallet. Your key will be encrypted locally using this password. This password will be required each time you need to unlock the wallet.
- **Temporary Usage**: If you prefer not to store your keys within the application, simply choose not to set a password. When the application quits, your key will be forgotten.

If a local wallet password is specified, the application will also save and encrypt your key for future use, using AES-256 encryption. The current password/key encryption scheme can [currently be found here](https://github.com/aaroncox/eos-voter/blob/master/app/shared/actions/wallet.js#L71-L86).
